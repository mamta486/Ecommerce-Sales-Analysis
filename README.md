📊 E-Commerce Sales Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales and profit data from a retail e-commerce store.
Using Python (Pandas, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook), I answered key business queries to understand revenue trends, product performance, and customer behavior.

The analysis provides actionable insights into sales, profits, and efficiency across different categories, sub-categories, and customer segments.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas)

Data Visualization: Plotly

Jupyter Notebook

Dataset: Sample Superstore (CSV)

📊 Business Queries Solved

1.Calculate monthly sales and identify the highest & lowest sales months.

2.Analyze sales by product categories (highest & lowest sales).

3.Perform sales analysis based on sub-categories.

4.Analyze monthly profit and determine the highest profit month.

5.Study profit distribution by category and sub-category.

6.Analyze sales and profit by customer segment.

7.Calculate and visualize the sales-to-profit ratio.

🔎 Key Insights
